# Graph-CNN-in-3D-Point-Cloud-Classification

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 2.7
tensorflow (>0.12)
```
### Installing instructions

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:maggie0106/Graph-CNN-in-3D-Point-Cloud-Classification.git
```
2. Install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download data       
We are using the data from 3D benchmark data set ModelNet http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/.     
The mesh polygon data format from ModelNet is preprocessed into Point Cloud format by  Charles R. Qi et al. (PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation, CVPR 2017 https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)   
Download the data and put it in the data folder from the following link: 
```

```
## Model
You choose between two models using different pooling scheme including global pooling and multi-resolution pooling.
* global pooling: no subsampling process, only aims at picking the global features.
* multi-resolution pooling: doing subsampling after each convolutional layer to shrink the graph dimension by farthest subsampling a subset of centroid points and preform max-pooling on each cluter formed by the nearest neighbor around each point in the subset.

## Run the demo
### To run global pooling model
```
cd global_pooling_model
python main.py
```
### To run multi-resolution pooling model
```
cd multi_res_pooling_model	
python main_multi_res.py	
```
