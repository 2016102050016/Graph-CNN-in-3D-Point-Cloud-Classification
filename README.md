## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```
### Installing instructions

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:maggie0106/Graph-CNN-in-3D-Point-Cloud-Classification.git
```
2. Install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download data       
We are using the data from 3D benchmark data set ModelNet http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/.     
The mesh polygon data format from ModelNet is preprocessed into Point Cloud format by  Charles R. Qi et al. (PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation, CVPR 2017 https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)   
Download the data and put it in the data folder from the following link: 
```
